# sexual-assault-analysis
This is a survey completed of 1,000 random individuals and their perceptions on
sexual assault and rape.
These answers are difficult to traditionally analyze because they have string values
versus numeric, thus, analysis was centered at finding as many interesting
correlations, causations, tabulations, frequencies. Bivariate and
univariate analysis, as well as many other analysis that seemed appropriate were conducted.
